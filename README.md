# Portfolio-Optimization

Created a portfolio of assets (Stocks and Cryptos) to get the maximum return and minimum risk.

The assets were selected from Yahoo Finance. We then cleaned the data and performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA). The cleaned data was visualized through time series analysis and we performed non-linear optimization of optimal stock allocation for different risk levels. We used a Pareto Chart to determine the assets to be selected for the Monte Carlo simulation. Here, we compared the results with S&P 500 and Dow Jones Index in the same time period. The objective was to find the probability with which our portfolio with chosen stock proportion will lose money. We then optimized the model with atleast 2 stocks receiving atleast 10% of the budget each.

Prerequisite: There will be a total of 8 assets (4 stocks and 4 cryptos). The market cap requirement for Stocks was $2 Billion - $10 Billion and for Cryptos less than or equal to $1 Billion.
